# Assignment #1 (Due: 6 October 2021 14:00)

Please have a look at the lecture notes on [Software Design LifeCycle (SDLC)](https://github.com/banbar/GMT-456-GIS-Programming/blob/master/1_Software_Design_LifeCycle.pdf).

Your task is as follows:
1. Create a GitHub account.
2. Associate your GitHub account with your [assignment](https://classroom.github.com/a/cS-w5Ehs).
3. Choose **one** of the SDLC methodologies and describe it in **your own words** as a markdown file. Use sections to improve legibility of your Readme file.
4. Complete the markdown file until the start of the course.

Some SDLC methodologies are:
* Waterfall
* Agile
* V model
* Spiral
* Lean

You **must** use the following commands:
* git init
* git config
* git status
* git add
* git commit
* git push

In other words you are **not** allowed to use the GitHub interface to edit your markdown file.

I would like to see your progress, so I encourage you start editing your markdown file today.

You may use [Atom](https://atom.io/) that is handy for editing markdown files.
